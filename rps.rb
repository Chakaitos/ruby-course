class RPS
  # Rock, Paper, Scissors
  # Make a 2-player game of rock paper scissors. It should have the following:
  #
  # It is initialized with two strings (player names).
  # It has a `play` method that takes two strings:
  #   - Each string reperesents a player's move (rock, paper, or scissors)
  #   - The method returns the winner (player one or player two)
  #   - If the game is over, it returns a string stating that the game is already over
  # It ends after a player wins 2 of 3 games
  #
  # You will be using this class in the following class, which will let players play
  # RPS through the terminal.
end

class RPSPlayer
  # (No specs are required for RPSPlayer)
  #
  # Complete the `start` method so that it uses your RPS class to present
  # and play a game through the terminal.
  #
  # The first step is to read (gets) the two player names. Feed these into
  # a new instance of your RPS class. Then `puts` and `gets` in a loop that
  # lets both players play the game.
  #
  # When the game ends, ask if the player wants to play again.

    # PRO TIP: Instead of using plain `gets` for grabbing a player's
    #          move, this line does the same thing but does NOT show
    #          what the player is typing! :D
    # This is also why we needed to require 'io/console'
    # move = STDIN.noecho(&:gets)

module Extensions
  # Extension Exercise
  #  - Takes an `array` of strings. Returns a hash with two keys:
  #    :most => the string(s) that occures the most # of times as its value.
  #    :least => the string(s) that occures the least # of times as its value.
  #  - If any tie for most or least, return an array of the tying strings.
  #
  # Example:
  #   result = Extensions.extremes(['x', 'x', 'y', 'z'])
  #   expect(result).to eq({ :most => 'x', :least => ['y', 'z'] })
  #
  def self.extremes(array)
