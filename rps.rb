  # and play a game through the terminal.
  #
  # The first step is to read (gets) the two player names. Feed these into
  # a new instance of your RPS class. Then `puts` and `gets` in a loop that
  # lets both players play the game.

  # When the game ends, ask if the player wants to play again.

    # PRO TIP: Instead of using plain `gets` for grabbing a player's
    #          move, this line does the same thing but does NOT show

module Extensions
  # Extension Exercise
  #  - Takes an `array` of strings. Returns a hash with two keys:
  #    :most => the string(s) that occures the most # of times as its value.
  #    :least => the string(s) that occures the least # of times as its value.
  #  - If any tie for most or least, return an array of the tying strings.
  #
  # Example:
  #   result = Extensions.extremes(['x', 'x', 'y', 'z'])
  #   expect(result).to eq({ :most => 'x', :least => ['y', 'z'] })
  #
  def self.extremes(array)
